### About myself
I am now a junior student at Zhejiang University. I did an internship in [VIPA](http://eagle.zju.edu.cn/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=11) with professor [Mingli song](http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/msong/0.html).

My research interests lie in generative models and computer vision.

I write [blogs]({{ site.url }}/blogs/) in Chinese occasionally. Here are my [publication list]({{ site.url }}/publications) and [CV]({{ site.url }}/static/resume_cv.pdf).

I am also interested in reading the source code of Tensorflow, welcome to discuss problems regarding to it with me.
